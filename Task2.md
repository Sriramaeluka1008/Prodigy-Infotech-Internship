# TASK 2: Conduct Compatibility Testing for a Basic Web Page

Test a simple web page across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile). Check for layout issues, broken links, and functionality discrepancies. Document any findings and recommend fixes for compatibility issues in Markdown.

## Test Cases for Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Compatibility

### 1. Layout and Rendering
**Description:** Verify the web page's layout and rendering consistency.  
**Steps:**
1. Open the web page in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and other browsers.
2. Resize browser windows to simulate different screen sizes (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile).
3. Check for issues like:
   - Misaligned elements
   - Incorrect spacing/margins
   - Broken images/videos
   - Text overlapping/cutting off
   - Incorrect font rendering
   - Missing elements/sections  
**Expected Result:** Consistent layout and rendering across all browsers and devices.

### 3. Device-Specific Issues
**Description:** Verify the web page's responsiveness and functionality on different devices.  
**Steps:**
1. Test on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
2. Check for touchscreen responsiveness, orientation changes, scrollbar behavior, virtual keyboard interaction.  
**Expected Result:** Responsive and functional on all tested devices.

### 4. Broken Links
**Description:** Check for broken links within the web page.  
**Steps:**
1. Click on all links within the web page.
2. Verify that each link leads to the correct destination.
3. Check for 404 errors or other link-related issues.  
**Expected Result:** All links are functional and lead to the correct destinations.

### 5. Accessibility
**Description:** Verify the web page's accessibility for users with disabilities.  
**Steps:**
1. Use accessibility testing tools (e.g., WAVE, aXe) to check for:
   - Proper use of ARIA attributes
   - Sufficient color contrast
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility  
**Expected Result:** The web page is accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG.

### 6. Performance
**Description:** Check the web page's loading speed and performance.  
**Steps:**
1. Use browser developer tools or performance testing tools (e.g., PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix) to measure loading times, render times, and other performance metrics.
2. Identify potential performance bottlenecks and optimize the web page accordingly.  
**Expected Result:** The web page loads quickly and performs efficiently across all browsers and devices.
